Creating a flow diagram for your application can be a visual representation of how different components interact with each other. While I can't create visual diagrams directly, I can provide you with a textual description of how the components in your application interact and flow. You can use this description to create a flow diagram using diagramming tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even on paper.

Here's a textual representation of the flow of your Express.js application:

Client Requests: A client sends HTTP requests to your server.

Express Middleware:

CORS Middleware: Allows cross-origin requests.
Morgan Middleware: Logs request information in the console.
Body Parser Middleware: Parses JSON and URL-encoded data in the request body.
Rate Limit Middleware: Limits the number of requests from a client in a given time frame.
Routing:

Incoming requests are routed to specific endpoints defined in your router file (Router.js).
Requests are matched based on HTTP methods (GET, POST) and URL paths.
Router (Router.js):

Defines various routes and their associated controller functions.
Middleware functions like access_Key are applied to specific routes for authentication or authorization.
Controller Functions:

Controller functions are responsible for handling specific business logic.
Examples include tokenGenerator, resetToken, convertor, liveRate, and historicalData.
These functions may interact with data sources, external APIs, or perform computations.
Access Key Middleware:

This middleware checks for the presence of an access key/token in the request headers or parameters.
It may perform authentication and authorization checks before allowing or denying access to protected routes.
Response Generation:

Controller functions generate responses, typically in JSON format.
Responses may include data, error messages, or status codes.
Client Response:

The server sends the generated response back to the client.
Server Listening:

The Express application is started, and it listens for incoming requests on port 3000 (app.listen).
Logging:

During the process, the morgan middleware logs request information in the console.
Rate Limiting:

The express-rate-limit middleware enforces rate limiting for certain routes to prevent abuse or overuse of the API.
This textual representation outlines the flow of your Express.js application. You can use this as a guide to create a visual flowchart or diagram using a diagramming tool of your choice.
